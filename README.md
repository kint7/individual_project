# individual_project

This is my individual project, where I use MSP (Message Send Protocol). In this project I created a Chat Application but a one-way communication.
I use YouTube, https://codinginfinite.com/python-chat-application-tutorial-source-code/ and Tutorials Point - Python for my references.
I created this for ITT440 - Network Programming for the need to pass this subject. Here are my source codes.
